# Ð¡hecklists templates and test runs for the demoqa.com website. Manual Software Testing

## Don't forget to give a :star: to make the project popular :) 

## :boom: What is it all about?
This project contains sample checklists for manual testers to help them save time for writing checklists. 

## :golf: Why was this project created?
Writing checklists is always a boring and tedious job that takes up most of the time when testing software. That's why I decided to create standard checklists for the functionality that is most often used in software testing using the example of the demoqa.com website, so that everyone can simply download a copy and use it directly in their projects, saving time spent on writing standard test cases.
